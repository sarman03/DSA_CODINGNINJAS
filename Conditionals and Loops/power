Find power of a number

Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.
Note : For this question, you can assume that 0 raised to the power of 0 is 1


Input format :
Two integers x and n (separated by space)
Output Format :
x^n (i.e. x raise to the power n)




#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int x, n, result = 1;
    cin >> x;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        result *= x;
    }

    cout << result;
    return 0;
}
