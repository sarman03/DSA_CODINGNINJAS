Write a program that takes a character as input and prints 1, 0, or -1 according to the following rules.
1, if the character is an uppercase alphabet (A - Z).
0, if the character is a lowercase alphabet (a - z).
-1, if the character is not an alphabet.

Example:
Input: Character is 'a'.

Output: 0

Explanation: The input character is lowercase, so our answer is 0.
Input format: The only line contains a single character.

Output format :
The only line contains 1, 0, or -1 according to the above rules.


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	char a;
	cin>>a;
if(a>='A' && a<='Z'){
		cout<<"1"<<endl;
        } else if (a >= 'a' && a <= 'z') {
          cout << "0" << endl;
        }else{
			cout<<"-1"<<endl;
		}
  }
